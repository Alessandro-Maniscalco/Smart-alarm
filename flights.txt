people lose flights due to unexpected traffic. i want to make a program that prevents this. I
 am thinking of it to play a sound when to wake me up. to know when to play the sound the use
 rs enters all the inofrmation of the destination on google maps. then on the program the use
 rs enters when the users wants to arrive at the destination and how much earlier then the de
 parture time it wants to wake up. then the program reloads the link on google, checks how mu
 ch time it take to get to the destination, adds the time to the current time plus the time t
 o wake up and sees if that is the time to arrive to the destination.
